1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
//code fragment 1
$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
$(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
//code fragment 2
$("li").each(function() {
$(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
//code fragment 3
$("li").each(function(idx) {
$(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });

All three code fragments are equivalent. They all set the color of the list to be yellow using jquery's each function.

The differences between the code fragments are the number of parrameters passed as the callback funciton.

Number 1 passes two parameters to the callback function, idx and e. idx is the index of the current element, and e is the DOM element. Inside the callback function, the e parameter is wrapped in a jQuery object using $(e), and its CSS color property is set to "yellow".
Number 2 does not pass any parameters to the callback function, but uses this to refer to the current element inside the function. 'this' is then wrapped in a jQuery object using $(this), and its CSS color property is set to "yellow".
Number 3 passes one parameter to the callback function, idx, which is the index of the current element. Same as number two the 'this' keyword is used to set the CSS color property to 'yellow'.

2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make
their text color be blue.
<body>
    <div>no ul here </div>
    <div>
        This does contain a ul.
        <ul>
            <li>the first item</li>
            <li>the second item</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <script>
        <!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
    </script>
</body>

$('div:has(ul)').css("color", blue);

3. Write jQuery code to append the following div element (and all of its contents) dynamically to the body
element.
<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>JS Bin</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

let divElement = $('<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>);
$('body').append(divElement);
