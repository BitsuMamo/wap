1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?

$("div > h1").css("background-color", "red");

2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
color red.
Sample HTML:

<body>
	<h1>abc</h1>
	<br>
	<div>
		<h1>div-1</h1>
		<h1>div-2</h1>
	</div>
	<h1>xyz</h1>
</body>


In jQuery terminology, the "jQuery function" refers to the global jQuery function, denoted by `$` or `jQuery`. It is a factory function that creates jQuery objects.

A "jQuery object" is an object that is returned by calling the jQuery function on a DOM element, a selector, or another jQuery object. It is a wrapper around one or more DOM elements that provides a set of methods for manipulating them.

When the jQuery function is called with a selector or a DOM element, it returns a jQuery object that contains a set of DOM elements that match the selector or the element itself. 

For example, `$("div")` returns a jQuery object that contains all `div` elements in the document.

Once a jQuery object is created, we can use its methods to manipulate its contents, apply CSS styles, bind event handlers, and more. For example, `$("div").addClass("highlight")` adds the CSS class "highlight" to all `div` elements.

In summary, the jQuery function creates jQuery objects, and jQuery objects provide a set of methods for manipulating DOM elements.



3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
	<!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
</script>
</head>
<body>
	<p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
</body>
</html>

$("p").append("YES!");
